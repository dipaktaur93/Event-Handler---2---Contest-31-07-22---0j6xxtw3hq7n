# Event handlers

In <code>src/components/App.js</code>, we have two buttons with id="button-a" and id="button-b"
respectively. And a function <code>handleClick</code> which takes an argument event.

Change the code such that, when we click on any button on screen it prints to console like this.

For example if we click button a, it prints 'Button id is:-button-a' 
and same for button-b or any other button we add in the app.
